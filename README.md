### A Team Name
RacketSynth

### Project Title
RacketSynth

### Project Concept
Our plan is to use The Racket GUI Toolkit to build an interface that we can wrap around the RSound library. 
This will allow users to select a particular type of wave to generate and a specific frequency to be used.

We would also like to extend the above features in order to build a synthesizer that can take keyboard inputs
to generate specific notes. 

### Libraries You Plan to Use 
RSound and The Racket Graphical Interface Toolkit
